## About Me

I am responsible, executive, diligent and persistent person.

I have some work experience in SEO (search engune optimization), SMM and internet advertising. I developed several websites based on templates of open CMS (Wordpress, Joomla). But I am interested in the related area - web development - and I want to evolve in it.

My motto: there is no limit to knowledge.

  for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
      if (Array.isArray(a[i])) {
          count += deepCount(a[i]);
